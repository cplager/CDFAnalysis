# HEPAnalysis

This is a copy of the cplager package on the CDF CVS server as well as other packages I wrote for both CDF and CMS. It has some of the standalone statistics tools that I wrote.

Most of these were only compiled under linux with gcc  3.x and require [Root](https://root.cern.ch) 5.x to be installed.
