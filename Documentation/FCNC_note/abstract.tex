  We search for the flavor changing neutral current decay of the top
  quark \tZq with $1.12\invfb$ of data. This decay is extremely rare in 
  the \sm, and a signal at the Tevatron would be an indication 
  of new physics. Using $Z+\ge4$ jet candidate events with and without a loose
  secondary vertex \btag, we expect an upper limit on the branching 
  fraction of $7.1\pm3.0\%$.
