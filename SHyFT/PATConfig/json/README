2010-08-08: Switched to the following scheme for json files:

   1.  Copy the most recent DCS-Only JSON file from the official area (see example below)
   2.  Use printJSON.py (form PythonUtilities) to make it more user friendly
   3.  Manually edit it to contain only the runs I want to process.

The JSON files names skim_DCS_* were created this way from DCSTRONLY_132440-142188.

2010-08-02: For adding to the prompt dataset after 250 nb^-1, created
a JSON file as follows:

wget https://cms-service-dqm.web.cern.ch/cms-service-dqm/CAF/certification/Collisions10/7TeV/DCSOnly/DCSTRONLY_132440-140388
wget https://cms-service-dqm.web.cern.ch/cms-service-dqm/CAF/certification/Collisions10/7TeV/DCSOnly/DCSTRONLY_132440-142188
compareJSON.py --sub DCSTRONLY_132440-142188 DCSTRONLY_132440-140388 custom_DCSTRONLY_140399_142188

Then edit custom_DCSTRONLY_140399_142188 to remove run 140359 already included in previous JSON file.

---

This directory contains copies of the JSON files copied from the
official area thusly:

wget https://cms-service-dqm.web.cern.ch/cms-service-dqm/CAF/certification/Collisions10/7TeV/DCSOnly/DCSTRONLY_132440-141876

The point is to maintain a "backup" copy of what file was actually
used, so that if a change occurs in the official file, we have a way
to tell which version was used for the jobs.  If you make a skim,
please commit the actual JSON file used for the skim here (if it's not
there already) so that we can keep track.
